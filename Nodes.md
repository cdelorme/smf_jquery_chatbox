Update Git Repo

The next step will be choosing a jQuery color picker to allow users to set their own colors for Background and Foreground.  Then JS events and AJAX to handle setting those to the DB.

Integrate chadmin.php page for administration.

- Add Bans by user_id
- List Banned Users
- Remove users from Banned List
- Delete Chat Messages by id

Create a history.php page to view old messages.
How do we make that work?

SSI.php included for integration with SMF.
Can then access and run core functions!

Need to establish some basic CSS that is non-colored for theme independence.

I have to (heavily) modify the install.xml and possibly package-info.xml files.

I then want to test the install from the Package Manager!  If that works I will be thrilled!

Once I get the package manager to install the ChatBox system, I will be able to upload it to SMF.
